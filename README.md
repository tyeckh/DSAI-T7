# SC1015-Project

## About
This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 which aims to analyze the dataset and identify significant factors that impact life expectancy, such as GDP, BMI, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. 


Do take a look at the powerpoint slides for a detailed walkthrough of our project!

## Motivation 
Our motivation for this project is to investigate the various factors that impact life expectancy, such as  demographic, health, and socio-economic factors. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the extent to which factors have significant impacts on life expectancy, and identify areas that require further attention and intervention. Ultimately,  with a better understanding of the factors and its significance, it would aid in the development of better public health policies and practices and promote a better quality of life for people across different regions and countries.
## Problem Definiton
 - What are main factors that affects life expectancy around the world
 - How can these areas be addressed effectively and efficiently around the world

## Datasets
- [Life Expectancy (WHO) Fixed](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated)

## Machine Learning Algorithms used
- Multivariate Linear Regression (Regression)
- Decision Tree (Classification & Regression)
- Random Forest (Regression)
- K-Neighbours (Regression)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron ANN (Regression)

## Conclusion
- Remaining lease has minimum correlation with resale price unexpectedly, so it seems to be less important factor affecting HDB resale prices
- Lease commence date and floor area is important variables as they have high correlation and linearity with HDB resale price
- Storey range, flat level and flat type are important variables that cause variations to HDB sale prices, while town seems to be less important

## What did we learn from this project
- We made use of Random Forest Regressors, K-Neighbours Regressors and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, which are new Machine Learning algorithms not taught in the course.
- We were able to apply Data science concepts taught in this course, like visualisation tools and tools to evaluate models
- We also learnt about the usage of github and information about life expectancy

## Special thanks
We would like to give appreciation to our Lab TA, Zou Yuxuan of NTU SCSE for being patient and responsive to our queries during our consultations in lab.
